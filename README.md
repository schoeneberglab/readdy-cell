**ReaDDy-Cell** is a whole-cell digital twin simulation framework built on the [ReaDDy](https://github.com/readdy/readdy) particle-based reaction-diffusion platform.
This implementation enables simulation of mitochondrial dynamics and intracellular transport directly from 4D lattice light-sheet microscopy (LLSM) data.
For full details, check out our preprint on BioxRiv! [*Whole-cell particle-based digital twin simulations from 4D lattice light-sheet microscopy data*](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.09.647865v1)

## Features
- **Automated Digital Twin Construction**: Factory methods for building spatially explicit, particle-based models of mitochondria, microtubules, plasma membrane, and nuclear envelope from live-cell imaging data.
- **Passive & Active Transport Dynamics**: Simulates mitochondrial diffusion and directed motor-driven active transport along microtubule topologies.
- **In-Browser Visualization**: Simulation trajectories are rendered using [Simularium Viewer](https://simularium.allencell.org).
